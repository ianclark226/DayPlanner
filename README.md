# Homework_05

Here is my day planner.  At the top of the html, displays the title, day, and time. One thing different from this planner than from the example is that it has the time and seconds counting down. It has hours 9am-5pm which is the average work day. What ever the curren hour is of the day, the textarea will be red. If the hours are in the future of the current hour, they will be green. If the hours are in the past, they will be gray. When you type out something in one of the textareas, you hit the save button to save it to local storage. The text will also appear in the same hour shot when on refresh(this was pretty challegning to achive. Thank you Vincent).
